// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
var Animals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Elephant"];
for (var _i = 0, Animals_1 = Animals; _i < Animals_1.length; _i++) {
    var pet = Animals_1[_i];
    if (pet == "Elephant") {
        console.log("An ".concat(pet, " would make a great pet because it's extremmely loyal"));
    }
    else {
        console.log("A ".concat(pet, " would make a great PET"));
    }
}
console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet because they're all loyal and kind in nature");
